### 2. Push Your Code

```bash
# Initialize git (if not already done)
git init

# Add all files
git add .

# Commit changes
git commit -m "Initial commit: School Platform with full-stack features"

# Add remote origin (replace YOUR_USERNAME)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/school-platform.git

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```
